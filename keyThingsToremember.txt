

VERY IMPORTANT
{when this "$("#uploader-class1").val()" returns a img and it gets 
stored in a folder then a var gets activated only then the image is displayed}

DONT FORGET
{the size of ever images should be same} 

so in the python file i first create a folder called training images and and inside that to 
folders clled class1 and class2 and put my class1 imgs in class1 folder and class2 in class2 folder
and then i present it to the augmentation
